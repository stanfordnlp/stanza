"""
MELD is a dataset of Friends (the TV show) utterances.  

The ratings include judgment based on the visuals, so it might be
harder than expected to directly extract from the text.  However, it
should broaden the scope of the model and doesn't seem to hurt
performance.

Files in the MELD repo are csv, with quotes in "..." if they contained commas themselves.

Accordingly, we use the csv module to read the files and output them in the format
<class> <sentence>

Run using 

python3 convert_MELD.py MELD/train_sent_emo.csv train.txt
