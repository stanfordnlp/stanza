"""Invokes the Java tsurgeon on a list of trees

Included with CoreNLP is a mechanism for modifying trees based on
existing patterns within a tree.  The patterns are found using tregex:

https://nlp.stanford.edu/nlp/javadoc/javanlp/edu/stanford/nlp/trees/tregex/TregexPattern.html

The modifications are then performed using tsurgeon:

https://nlp.stanford.edu/nlp/javadoc/javanlp/edu/stanford/nlp/trees/tregex/tsurgeon/Tsurgeon.html

This module accepts Tree objects as produced by the conparser and
returns the modified trees that result from one or more tsurgeon
operations.

TODO: add a unit test once CoreNLP 4.3.3 is released
