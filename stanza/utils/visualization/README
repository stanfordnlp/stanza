# Overview

The code in this directory contains tooling required for Semgrex and Ssurgeon visualization.
Searching dependency graphs and manipulating them can be a time consuming and challenging task to get right.
Semgrex is a system for searching dependency graphs and Ssurgeon is a system for manipulating the output of Semgrex.
The compact language used by these systems allows for easy command line or API processing of dependencies.

We now offer Semgrex and Ssurgeon through a web interface, now accessible via Streamlit with visualizations.

## How to run visualizations through Streamlit

Streamlit can be used to visualize Semgrex and Ssurgeon results and process files.
Here are instructions for setting up a Streamlit webpage:

1. install Streamlit. `pip install streamlit`
2. install Stanford CoreNLP if you have not. You can find an installation here: https://stanfordnlp.github.io/CoreNLP/download.html
3. set the $CLASSPATH environment variable to your local installation of CoreNLP.
4. install streamlit, spacy, and ipython.  You can use the "visualization" stanza setup option for that
5. Run `streamlit run stanza/utils/visualization/semgrex_app.py --theme.backgroundColor "#FFFFFF"`

This should begin a Streamlit runtime application on your local machine that can be interacted with.
