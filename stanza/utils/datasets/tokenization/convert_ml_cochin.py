"""
Convert a Malayalam NER dataset to a tokenization dataset using
the additional labeling provided by TTec's Indian partners

This is still WIP - ongoing discussion with TTec and the team at UFAL
doing the UD Malayalam dataset - but if someone wants the data to
recreate it, feel free to contact Prof. Manning or John Bauer

Data was annotated through Datasaur by TTec - possibly another team
involved, will double check with the annotators.

#1 current issue with the data is a difference in annotation style
observed by the UFAL group.  I believe TTec is working on reannotating
this.

Discussing the first sentence in the first split file:

> I am not sure about the guidelines that the annotators followed, but
> I would not have split നാമജപത്തോടുകൂടി as നാമ --- ജപത്തോടുകൂടി. Because
> they are not multiple syntactic words. I would have done it like
> നാമജപത്തോടു --- കൂടി as കൂടി ('with') can be tagged as ADP. I agree with
> the second MWT വ്യത്യസ്തം --- കൂടാതെ.
>
> In Malayalam, we do have many words which potentially can be treated
> as compounds and split but sometimes it becomes difficult to make
> that decision as the etymology or the word formation process is
> unclear. So for the Malayalam UD annotations I stayed away from
> doing it because I didn't find it necessary and moreover the
> guidelines say that the words should be split into syntactic words
> and not into morphemes.

As for using this script, create a directory extern_data/malayalam/cochin_ner/
The original NER dataset from Cochin University going there:
extern_data/malayalam/cochin_ner/final_ner.txt
The relabeled data from TTEC goes in
extern_data/malayalam/cochin_ner/relabeled_tsv/malayalam_File_1.txt.tsv etc etc

This can be invoked from the command line, or it can be used as part of
stanza/utils/datasets/prepare_tokenizer_treebank.py ml_cochin
in which case the conll splits will be turned into tokenizer labels as well
