"""
The BaseModel is passed to the transitions so that the transitions
can operate on a parsing state without knowing the exact
representation used in the model.

For example, a SimpleModel simply looks at the top of the various stacks in the state.

A model with LSTM representations for the different transitions may
attach the hidden and output states of the LSTM to the word /
constituent / transition stacks.

Reminder: the parsing state is a list of words to parse, the
transitions used to build a (possibly incomplete) parse, and the
constituent(s) built so far by those transitions.  Each of these
components are represented using stacks to improve the efficiency
of operations such as "combine the most recent 4 constituents"
or "turn the next input word into a constituent"
